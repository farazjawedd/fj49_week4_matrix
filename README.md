# About the project:

# Spotify Data Analysis

This Python project analyzes data from the Spotify API, which is stored in a CSV file named `spotify.csv`. It provides insights into song lengths and identifies the top 10 artists with the most chart-topping hits between 2010 and 2022.

## Features

Descriptive statistics on song lengths (in milliseconds) to showcase the variation:

- `Mean = 226033`
- `Median = 221653`
- `Mode = 236133`
- `Std = 42063`

Visualization of the top 10 artists with the most chart-topping hits.
